## Description

Real-time segmentation plays a crucial role in the realm of biomedical imaging due to its profound impact on both diagnosis and treatment planning. Real-time segmentation algorithms allow for the immediate and precise identification of various anatomical structures and pathological regions within the brain, enabling radiologists and clinicians to swiftly assess the patient's condition.

We'll learn how to use segmentation models for real-time segmentation of MRI brain scans. For this purpose we're going to use FastSAM.
The Fast Segment Anything Model (FastSAM) is a CNN Segment Anything Model trained on a mere 2% of the SA-1B dataset as disclosed by the authors of SAM (Meta). According to FastSAM authors, it attains similar performance compared to SAM while operating at 50 times the speed. Nonetheless, FastSAM seems to have lower segmentation results than classical U-Nets and might be more adapted to smart cities / autonomous driving applications.

## In this repository you'll find:

* A jupyter notebook file.
* A data folder which contains an image and a video of a MRI brain scan.
* The data folder also includes an empty folder which will be used to process the video.
